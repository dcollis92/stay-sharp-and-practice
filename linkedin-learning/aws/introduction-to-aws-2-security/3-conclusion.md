### 3.1 Study Break: Exam Tips and Resources

Transcript:
Feeling ready? Let's go over some exam tips to help you prep for success. In this video, we will be going over contents that will be relevant to the security domain of the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. We will go over the shared responsibility model, principle of least privilege, security pillar of a Well-Architected Framework, and the security services. Let's get started. The security domain is concerned with how to make sure your IT infrastructure hosted on AWS Cloud, is safe from both internal and external security threats. There are a few concepts related to this, such as the shared responsibility model, the security pillar of the Well-Architected Framework, and the principle of least privilege. In the shared responsibility model, the most important concept to understand is that you as the customer, and AWS as the cloud computing service provider, share the responsibility of keeping AWS Cloud secure. Customers are responsible for security in the cloud and AWS is responsible for security of the cloud. How do you make sure you're keeping the information in the cloud secure? You should only provide the least amount of access possible for any entity to make sure that no one has access to resources they are not entitled to. This concept is called the principle of least privilege. Finally, the security pillar of the Well-Architected Framework states that the security of the cloud is composed of identity and access management, detective controls, infrastructure protection, data protection, and incident response. We also went over a few core security related AWS services such as AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM, AWS Web Application Firewall, or WAF, AWS Shield, Amazon Inspector, AWS Trusted Advisor, and Amazon GuardDuty. You should be familiar with what each of these services do and how they contribute to helping keep AWS Cloud secure. If you are unsure about any of the concepts or services we just discussed, feel free to check back on the videos, or even the study break videos to review. A few extra minutes making sure you have the services or concepts straightened out could mean a few extra points on the certification exam.
