### Study Break: Exam Tips and Resources

Transcript:
We began this course with what even is the cloud? Since then, we've come a long way. Let's get prepped for the exam. We've learned about the cloud, cloud computing, Amazon Web Services, and various but essential cloud computing concepts to help begin the preparation process for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam. In this video, we will review major concepts you should know about for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam's Cloud Concepts domain. These topics are what is AWS? Six advantages of cloud computing, three cloud computing models, three cloud computing deployments, and five pillars of a well architected framework. We will also throw in some study tips for memorizing certain concepts in preparation for the exam, let's get started. The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is the most fundamental certification exam that AWS offers to help validate the candidates' overall fundamental understanding of the AWS cloud. It includes four domains which are cloud concepts security, technology, and billing and pricing. We began with cloud computing and then went over to the cloud concepts domain. For the cloud concepts domain part of the exam, AWS wants you to define the AWS cloud and its value proposition, identify aspects of AWS cloud economics and list the different cloud architecture design principles. AWS or Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform created by Amazon and currently holds the world's highest market share in the cloud computing sphere. It provides many different IT services on the cloud and helps to make it easier, faster and cheaper to run your IT infrastructure compared with legacy on-premises IT infrastructure. According to AWS, there are six distinct advantages of utilizing cloud computing over on-premises IT infrastructure. The advantages are trade capital expense for variable expense, benefit from massive economies of scale, stop guessing about capacity, increase speed and agility, stop spending money running and maintaining data centers and go global in minutes. Basically, utilizing cloud computing is faster, cheaper and more agile than utilizing your own data centers. There are three types of cloud computing models and three types of cloud computing deployments. The three types of cloud computing models are Software as a Service, SaaS, Infrastructure as a Service, IaaS and Platform as a Service, PaaS. The three types of cloud computing deployments are public cloud, hybrid cloud and private or on-premises cloud. Want a way to memorize them? Try out my silly memorization method, SIP PHO. SIP is an acronym for the three cloud computing models: software as a service, infrastructure as a service and platform as a service. And oh boy, do I love myself a good bowl of Pho, PHO stands for the cloud computing deployment models: public, hybrid and on-premises or private cloud. There are six pillars in a well architected framework. They provide best practices for specific areas of running an AWS cloud IT infrastructure. To help me memorize these six pillars, I created the acronym CROPSS with two S's. The pillars are cost optimization, reliability, operational excellence, performance efficiency, security and sustainability. What do you think? Do you think you'd be able to answer questions in regards to all of the topics we learned about in this course? If not, please, don't hesitate to go back and re-watch some of the videos and take notes.
