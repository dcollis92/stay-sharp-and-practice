Java is one of the most popular programming languages for beginners. Why? Java can be used to create applications on the web, mobile, desktop, and many other platforms.

We are going to talk about programming fundamentals, such as loops, functions, and classes, and learn how to use them to create programs in Java. Along the way, we will be using real-world examples and you will be challenged with writing programs that include these new topics that we'll be discussing.
