# Learning Regular Expressions

## Conclusion

Transcript:
Thank you for taking Learning Regular Expressions with me. Regular expressions are an invaluable tool, especially for programmers. You can use them to search your code, to validate data, or to do find-and-replace operations. I use them a lot. If a client gives me comma-delimited data, and I need to convert it into JSON, I write a regex for it. If I want to search a long text document looking for IP addresses, I use a regex. If I want to validate the format of an e-mail address submitted by a web form, I write a regex for it, and if I need to reformat phone numbers in a database, I write a regex. I hope you find them as useful as I do. It may take time to build your skills. Don't get frustrated if your expressions aren't quite right at the start. Crafting a regex that matches exactly what you want and nothing more is the hard part. Hands-on experience and learning from your mistakes are the only ways to improve. Until next time, happy coding.
