### 1.1 What is the Cloud?

Transcript:
The cloud, you've heard it, it's on the cloud, we can do that on the cloud, back it up to the cloud. It's impossible to escape it in the tech world, but what exactly is it? I imagine you have a big idea of what the cloud is as something floating up there in the sky that has something to do with data storage, somehow. Yeah, you're on the right track. In reality the cloud is actually just a new hip way to refer to the internet. Nothing mysterious at all. We all use it every day. But now we have to consider, do we really know what the internet is? In the most fundamental sense, the internet is a worldwide network of billions and billions of devices. These devices can be computers, servers, cell phones, tablets, or Amazon Alexas. As long as they are connected using the global network, any computer can communicate with any other computer thanks to the internet. And despite things like wifi and cell phone services making it seem like the internet is up there in the sky, the internet is still created and connected using physical cables. These can be TV cables, fiber optic cables, or copper telephone wires. When you open your favorite web browser and type in a website URL, it sends a request. The request is sent to your internet service provider, which is the company you contract with to provide you internet service. Your internet service provider then sends your request to a server which searches for the domain name you requested. If it finds a match it will route your request to the IP address of the server hosting the website. Once your request hits the server of the website you wanted to load, the server responds by sending the web page in little packets back to your computer. The packets are very small and acts like jigsaw pieces that your computer reassembles to load the whole entire web page. So the cloud is the internet and the internet is a global network of billions and billions of devices communicating with each other. And you, as a user of the internet, and the cloud, facilitate the transfer of information across the world faster than ever before.

### What is Cloud Computing?

Transcript:
- So, we have this cloud that connects all of our devices together. Through it, we can pass information back and forth, store data, and do other cool stuff. You have to be wondering, what powers the cloud? How does it get its energy? How does it stay on? The answer to that, my friends, is cloud computing. You're used to storing files on your hard drive, right? Sometimes, it's a pain to transport that data wherever you go. I know I've forgotten that precious USB stick before. Well, cloud computing solves that issue. It lets you access your data from wherever, as long as you have an internet connection. The technical definition of cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute, database storage, application, and other IT resources. This means through cloud computing services, you have instantaneous access to computational, storage, and software using the internet. Computing resources available when you want it, where you want it. So, cloud computing is quite convenient. It's also very flexible when it comes to cost. Instead of the traditional buy first to use model, like when you buy a computer or car, cloud computing utilizes the pay as you go model. This means that you only pay for resources you use when you use them. For example, say you wanted a server to run your applications on. In the traditional way, you would have to go through a procurement process at your work to find an appropriate server with all the necessary bells and whistles. You would then have to make sure the capacity you are purchasing for isn't too much or too little. Then you have to get the quote from the manufacturer and then wrestle with the finance department to get the budget approved and device purchased. If the demands from the applications are much higher or lower than expected, you have to go back and go through the procurement process all over again to get a more appropriate server. Your department or company needs to have the funds to then purchase that equipment outright. Cloud computing allows you to pay to use only as much server space and capacity as you need at that moment. When you need more or less, you can adjust the rented capacity and your monthly bill will adjust along with it. Instead of a large overhead bill on purchasing a piece of hardware that may or may not even match your needs, you get a monthly statement billing you only for as much as you used last month. Cloud computing facilitates collaborations by allowing you to hold virtual meetings, edit documents together, and communicate via email or messaging services. Many of these services that used to cost a lot of money to purchase and maintain can now be purchased by bootstrap startups for $10 a user a month. Cloud computing allows for instantaneous access to computational, storage, and software resources using the internet when and where you want it. It allows for increased flexibility and affordability, because you are only charged for what you consume when you consume. They allow what used to be only possible with big corporate IT budgets to almost anyone with internet access and a few dollars.

### A Brief History of the Cloud

Transcript: How did the idea of cloud computing develop? To start from the beginning we have to go all the way back to the 1950s with the invention of mainframe computing. Mainframe computing is the concept of having a central computer accessed by numerous user devices. The central computer which had all the compute capabilities was called the mainframe computer. All the user devices which sent requests out to the mainframe computer were called dumb terminals. These days if you peek into a college computer lab there are computers at every desk fully independent from the ones around it. Back in the '50s however, computers were extremely expensive to buy and maintain. So instead of placing one at every seat organizations would buy one mainframe computer and allow the dumb terminals to share its compute resources. In the '70s the concept of virtual machines emerged. Virtual machines are multiple complete operating systems that quote unquote live in a single piece of hardware. For example, you can have multiple Windows virtual machines living in your single Mac laptop. Suddenly, one single mainframe computer could have multiple operating systems running at the same time to do many different things. Then, a new idea hit them. What if we could use lots of mainframe computers' resources as if it's just one computer? This was the beginning of the modern concept of cloud computing. To make pooling resources a reality developers created a software called a hypervisor that could be installed onto multiple pieces of hardware such as a server. They could then link all of those hardwares and use their combined computational storage powers as one giant resource. Imagine the amount of storage and computing power you can harness by adding up all the memory and hard drive space of every computer in your office. Programs will run super fast and you can store a lot of files and you will be able to analyze data at blazing speed. This is what cloud computing allows people to do in an extremely large scale using the Internet to connect end users to huge computational hardwares in their data centers.

### Cloud Computing in Daily Life

Transcript: The cloud, it's everywhere. I bet you use it more than you think. Let's start with email, something you use everyday. Cloud computing powers the storage and transfer of your messages so you can communicate with your friends and family. Streaming services. You know, Netflix, Hulu, that kind of thing. When we stream movies and TV shows, we benefit from streaming of video resources using cloud computing. These companies store video files on a cloud computing platform and allow thousands of people to access the same video at once. The bandwidth necessary for each video changes every second and cloud computing services can adjust it depending on the traffic. Many people use the personal account features of Office 365, like Outlook.com, without realizing it's a cloud computing platform. Google Cloud encompasses many of the features of your Google account, which includes popular services like Gmail, Google Drive, Google Photos, Google Hangouts, Google Calendar, and YouTube. Google Drive is a cloud storage platform for your photos, files, and videos. You can set up automatic backup to the Google Drive so you can save important files directly from your computer's hard disk to the cloud. It can also be used a cloud computing power collaboration tool for you to edit files with your colleagues or friends. You can get real-time feedback from your collaborators and as soon as a change is made by another user, you can see it reflected on your browser. For many popular cloud computing services, there is a free tier that most of us use. If you decide you need more space or features, they have subscription plans available for all different levels of computational needs, such as more space or accounts. The change in the amount or type of resources you can access is instantaneous and you can immediately enjoy your expanded storage space or added services. When you no longer want the extra perks, you can change your account tier again and from then on you will only be charged for the new amount of resources you're consuming. Cloud computing services allow us to consume, produce, and collaborate like never before and instantaneously. Many of them are quite inexpensive and some are even free. Can you think of other popular websites or services you often use that utilize cloud computing?
