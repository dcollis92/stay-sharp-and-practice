### 1.1 What is the Cloud?

Transcript:
The cloud, you've heard it, it's on the cloud, we can do that on the cloud, back it up to the cloud. It's impossible to escape it in the tech world, but what exactly is it? I imagine you have a big idea of what the cloud is as something floating up there in the sky that has something to do with data storage, somehow. Yeah, you're on the right track. In reality the cloud is actually just a new hip way to refer to the internet. Nothing mysterious at all. We all use it every day. But now we have to consider, do we really know what the internet is? In the most fundamental sense, the internet is a worldwide network of billions and billions of devices. These devices can be computers, servers, cell phones, tablets, or Amazon Alexas. As long as they are connected using the global network, any computer can communicate with any other computer thanks to the internet. And despite things like wifi and cell phone services making it seem like the internet is up there in the sky, the internet is still created and connected using physical cables. These can be TV cables, fiber optic cables, or copper telephone wires. When you open your favorite web browser and type in a website URL, it sends a request. The request is sent to your internet service provider, which is the company you contract with to provide you internet service. Your internet service provider then sends your request to a server which searches for the domain name you requested. If it finds a match it will route your request to the IP address of the server hosting the website. Once your request hits the server of the website you wanted to load, the server responds by sending the web page in little packets back to your computer. The packets are very small and acts like jigsaw pieces that your computer reassembles to load the whole entire web page. So the cloud is the internet and the internet is a global network of billions and billions of devices communicating with each other. And you, as a user of the internet, and the cloud, facilitate the transfer of information across the world faster than ever before.

### What is Cloud Computing?

Transcript:
- So, we have this cloud that connects all of our devices together. Through it, we can pass information back and forth, store data, and do other cool stuff. You have to be wondering, what powers the cloud? How does it get its energy? How does it stay on? The answer to that, my friends, is cloud computing. You're used to storing files on your hard drive, right? Sometimes, it's a pain to transport that data wherever you go. I know I've forgotten that precious USB stick before. Well, cloud computing solves that issue. It lets you access your data from wherever, as long as you have an internet connection. The technical definition of cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute, database storage, application, and other IT resources. This means through cloud computing services, you have instantaneous access to computational, storage, and software using the internet. Computing resources available when you want it, where you want it. So, cloud computing is quite convenient. It's also very flexible when it comes to cost. Instead of the traditional buy first to use model, like when you buy a computer or car, cloud computing utilizes the pay as you go model. This means that you only pay for resources you use when you use them. For example, say you wanted a server to run your applications on. In the traditional way, you would have to go through a procurement process at your work to find an appropriate server with all the necessary bells and whistles. You would then have to make sure the capacity you are purchasing for isn't too much or too little. Then you have to get the quote from the manufacturer and then wrestle with the finance department to get the budget approved and device purchased. If the demands from the applications are much higher or lower than expected, you have to go back and go through the procurement process all over again to get a more appropriate server. Your department or company needs to have the funds to then purchase that equipment outright. Cloud computing allows you to pay to use only as much server space and capacity as you need at that moment. When you need more or less, you can adjust the rented capacity and your monthly bill will adjust along with it. Instead of a large overhead bill on purchasing a piece of hardware that may or may not even match your needs, you get a monthly statement billing you only for as much as you used last month. Cloud computing facilitates collaborations by allowing you to hold virtual meetings, edit documents together, and communicate via email or messaging services. Many of these services that used to cost a lot of money to purchase and maintain can now be purchased by bootstrap startups for $10 a user a month. Cloud computing allows for instantaneous access to computational, storage, and software resources using the internet when and where you want it. It allows for increased flexibility and affordability, because you are only charged for what you consume when you consume. They allow what used to be only possible with big corporate IT budgets to almost anyone with internet access and a few dollars.
