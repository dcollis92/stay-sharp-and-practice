### 0.1 How Did We Get in the Cloud?

Transcript:
You've probably heard of the cloud in the past few years referring to ambiguous things that no one quite seems to be able to define. You might have also heard about Amazon Web Services. Perhaps your company is considering utilizing it or you're looking to find out more about this cloud computing platform that's taking the world by storm for your own career advancement. Whatever the reason may be that got you to click on this course, I'm glad you're here. I want to help you start from what even is the cloud to getting excited about Amazon Web Services, cloud computing, and potentially even considering taking the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam. Hi, I'm Hiro Nishimura and I'm Special Education Teacher turned System Administrator, turned Technical Writer and my mission is to introduce cloud computing and Amazon Web Services to people with non-traditional technical backgrounds. In Introduction to AWS for Non-Engineers One, Cloud Concepts, we will be starting from the beginning, and by beginning I mean the 50s, to begin exploring how cloud computing came to be, why it's important, and how Amazon Web Services, or AWS, fits into the picture. We will also be reviewing various cloud computing concepts that will help you begin studying for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam, which is the most fundamental certification exam that AWS offers. I can't wait to begin our cloud journey. Let's get started.

### 0.2 AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam

Transcript:
The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam confirms a candidate's overall understanding of cloud computing and Amazon Web Services. It also provides an industry-recognized validation of their knowledge. Candidates are encouraged to have at least six month of experience with AWS Cloud, as well as basic understanding of IT services and their uses within the AWS Cloud infrastructure. The exam is 100 US dollars, and candidates have 90 minutes to complete the multiple choice exam at a test center or remotely at home. Upon completion of the exam, they immediately get a pass or fail notification. The exam is available in English, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese. The Certified Cloud Practitioner exam covers four domains which are, cloud concepts, security, technology, and billing and pricing. The second largest portion of the exam is the cloud concepts domain, which makes up 28% of the exam. You would be asked to define the AWS Cloud, why it's desirable over alternatives, identify aspects of AWS Cloud economics, and describe the different cloud architecture design principles. The security domain makes up 24% of the questions on this exam. This section asks you to define the AWS shared responsibility model and the AWS Cloud security and compliance concepts. It also wants you to identify AWS access management capabilities and ways to find resources for troubleshooting security related issues. The largest portion of the exam is the technology domain, which makes up 36% of the exam. You would need to define methods for deploying and operating IT applications in the AWS Cloud, define the AWS global infrastructure, identify core AWS services, and identify ways to contact or receive technical support if you ran into issues. Last but not least, the billing and pricing domain makes up 12% of the exam. While this domain makes up the smallest portion of the exam, the questions are a little trickier because you need to memorize the different pricing models for AWS. They also want you to recognize the various account structures in relation to AWS billing and pricing, and identify resources available for billing support. The AWS Cloud Practitioner certification exam wants you to have a very broad understanding of AWS Cloud, but you do not need to do anything hands-on in order to pass the exam. All of the questions are multiple choice and completed at the test center or on your laptop at home. While working within AWS Cloud is definitely recommended, it is not mandatory for you to have six months of hands-on experience before you have enough knowledge to pass the exam.

### 0.3 Cloud Concepts Domain

Transcript:
There are four domains in the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam. They are cloud concepts, security, technology, and billing and pricing. The four courses in the Introduction to AWS for Non-Engineers series follow these four domains. This first course mainly covers the cloud concepts domain of the certification exam and provides vital fundamental information about cloud computing, its history, and the major players in the cloud computing platforms. Cloud concepts is the second largest domain in the exam and goes over many of the core concepts and benefits of utilizing cloud computing services. For this portion of the exam, AWS wants you to define the AWS Cloud and its value proposition, identify aspects of AWS Cloud economics, and list the different cloud architecture design principles. In this course, you will contemplate questions like what exactly is cloud computing? What makes it different from legacy IT infrastructure? How is the way you pay for resources different from buying and setting up the hardware in your on-premises data centers? You will also learn about concepts like well-architected framework for building IT infrastructure, types of cloud computing, type of cloud computing deployments, and advantages of cloud computing over legacy IT infrastructure. Let's get started with learning about what the cloud is, why cloud computing is taking the world by storm, and what Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud computing platform in the world, is used for.
