### 2.1 Advantage of Cloud Computing

Transcript:
So, why cloud computing? Think of it this way, you don't have to buy a computer with a huge hard disk because you can save your files on the cloud using services like Dropbox. Not only that, but these files are available from any machine connected to the internet. You don't need to buy an expensive gaming computer to play graphics-heavy games because you can use a web service like Parsec to play games on their server loaded with enough memory for seamless playing. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars for a program that you install onto your computer, you could pay a $10 a month, subscribe to a service, to use it through your web browser. How does this work for large businesses? If you are thinking in terms of your company's IT infrastructure, you no longer need to have people setting up physical servers and cabling. The countless hours and dollars spent maintaining a server room and the technology inside can now be used elsewhere. Even things like temperature regulation in a server room could be a source of headaches when setting up the IT department. When a piece of hardware breaks, you have to go through the whole procurement and setup process, which could take months. Cloud computing makes all of that the service provider's issue to solve and gives you a set fee to use the services over the internet. With cloud computing, you pay only when and what you consume. This avoids the overhead cost of buying too much physical space on-premises. If you are about to run out, you can simply scale up on the cloud within minutes. I don't know about you, but I'm into saving money wherever possible. The cloud computing service providers take care of the physical infrastructure and their own huge data centers, so you and your engineers can worry about other more interesting things, saving you manpower and money. You also benefit from the massive economy of scale, since larger cloud computing providers buy their capacities in huge quantities, they are able to offer a portion of their capacity to you for a much lower price than if you try to go out and get it for yourself. There are six major advantages to cloud computing. You can trade capital expense for variable expense. Benefit from massive economies of scale. Stop guessing about capacity. Increase speed and agility. Stop spending money running data centers. And go global in minutes. You no longer have to worry about buying too little or too much of something, and you only pay as you go, allowing you to focus your attention and money elsewhere.

### 2.2 Cloud Computing Models

Transcript:
There are three main cloud computing models, software as a service or SaaS, platform as a service or PaaS, and infrastructure as a service or IaaS. Infrastructure as a service also known as IaaS refers to the basic building blocks of cloud IT infrastructure. You have control over the networking, security, computer, and servers. IaaS provides the most flexibility and management control of all the different types of cloud computing models, and it's the closest in features to having the traditional on-premises data center. Some examples of infrastructure as a service platforms are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. You can modify and control almost all parts of the infrastructure in the cloud to fit your needs without having to purchase or manage actual hardware. Platform as a service known as PaaS allows you to deploy and manage applications without worrying about the underlying hardware infrastructure. Services offered could be web servers, databases, operating systems, or environments where you can execute specific programming languages to host applications. Some examples of PaaS are Microsoft Azure web hosting, Google App Engine, and Heroku. You can focus on deploying the applications instead of the operational side of deployment. PaaS is different from IaaS in that there is less flexibility as packages are preconstructed. But, you also have to deal with less of the infrastructure deployment and maintenance allowing you more time and resources to focus on the project at hand as opposed to the infrastructure. Software as a service, SaaS, describes completed products managed by the service provider. You get the whole package of the service complete with user interfaces. It's ready for use by an end user regardless of their technical backgrounds. You don't have to worry about how the service infrastructure is maintained or managed. You only have to worry about how you might use the service to fulfill a need. A very popular example of SaaS platform is a cloud-based email service such as Outlook and Gmail. As the user you only need to create an account to log in to send and receive emails, no need to worry about anything else. In terms of complexity and level of involvement required, infrastructure as a service is the most involved and requires the highest level of technical knowledge to execute, followed by platform as a service. Software as a service generally does not require much technical knowledge and it's extremely intuitive and features are ready to use quote unquote out of the box. So you and your team will have to decide which choice is right for your needs and circumstances.
