### 3.1 A Brief History of AWS

Add to cart, checkout, confirm payment. Rejoice. I imagine most of you have experienced this cycle, that visceral joy you get from online retail therapy, and no other company is better at facilitating it than the e-commerce giant, Amazon. A company had a market cap of $1 trillion in 2018 becoming only the second company in the United States to ever hit that mark. Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994 as a humble online bookstore before most of us even considered buying anything online. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, the cloud services platform did not come around for almost a decade after the bookstore turned retail giant was founded. And it brought a completely new side to their business. The framework for Amazon Web Services was launched internally within Amazon all the way back in 2002. At that time, it was called Amazon.com Web Service. Amazon was planning to launch merchant.com, an e-commerce service that helped third-party shops create online shopping websites using Amazon's e-commerce engine. Developing this platform helped to pave the way for Amazon to evolve from an online store to a service company. Surprisingly, it took several years for any real competitors to arrive in the cloud computing platform arena, which has contributed to AWS maintaining its majority market share in the industry. However, the gap is quickly being bridged by other large cloud computing platforms like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud gaining more and more of the market share every year. It has only been a little over a decade since the very first service was launched in AWS, but the platform has grown exponentially both in its customer base and service offerings. The cloud computing platform currently has over one million active customers. And in 2017, 10% of Amazon's revenue came from AWS.

### 3.2 What is AWS?

Transcript:
Before I even knew what the cloud meant or what cloud computing does, I had heard of AWS and knew that it was a big deal in the tech industry. It took only a quick Google search to find out that AWS stands for Amazon Web Services. From the name, I surmised that it was an Amazon product. I was however, completely unprepared for the extent of the types and number of services AWS provided for organizations all over the world. AWS offers IT infrastructure services to businesses and organizations as web services to help them scale and grow efficiently. AWS provides what used to be purchased as hardware, such as network switches and servers, as resources to be accessed using the internet. Because of cloud computing's pay as you go model and robust resources, organizations are able to save time, money, and human resources by moving their resources to AWS. As of winter 2020, there are 24 groups of services offered by the platform ranging from compute to storage to game development. Each group contains anywhere between one to 12 services with more being added all the time. You can host your static files using simple stores service, host a WordPress blog using elastic compute cloud, send emails using work mail, stream desktops using workspaces or create games using game lift. It's probably not far from the truth to say that your imagination is the limit for what you can potentially architect and create using Amazon Web Services. As a cloud computing service provider, AWS boasts flexibility, scalability, and reliability alongside affordability that was impossible with traditional on premises IT infrastructure. With AWS, engineers can concentrate on building your products and features instead of worrying about the it infrastructure's ability to handle their scaling.
