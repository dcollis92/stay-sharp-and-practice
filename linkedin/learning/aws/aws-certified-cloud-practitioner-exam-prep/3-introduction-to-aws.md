Add to cart, checkout, confirm payment. Rejoice. I imagine most of you have experienced this cycle, that visceral joy you get from online retail therapy, and no other company is better at facilitating it than the e-commerce giant, Amazon. A company had a market cap of $1 trillion in 2018 becoming only the second company in the United States to ever hit that mark. Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994 as a humble online bookstore before most of us even considered buying anything online. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, the cloud services platform did not come around for almost a decade after the bookstore turned retail giant was founded. And it brought a completely new side to their business. The framework for Amazon Web Services was launched internally within Amazon all the way back in 2002. At that time, it was called Amazon.com Web Service. Amazon was planning to launch merchant.com, an e-commerce service that helped third-party shops create online shopping websites using Amazon's e-commerce engine. Developing this platform helped to pave the way for Amazon to evolve from an online store to a service company. Surprisingly, it took several years for any real competitors to arrive in the cloud computing platform arena, which has contributed to AWS maintaining its majority market share in the industry. However, the gap is quickly being bridged by other large cloud computing platforms like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud gaining more and more of the market share every year. It has only been a little over a decade since the very first service was launched in AWS, but the platform has grown exponentially both in its customer base and service offerings. The cloud computing platform currently has over one million active customers. And in 2017, 10% of Amazon's revenue came from AWS.
