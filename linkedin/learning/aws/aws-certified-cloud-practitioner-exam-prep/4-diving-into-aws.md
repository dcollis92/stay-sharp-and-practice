### 4.1 Popular Services Offered in AWS

Transcript:
Compute services provide virtual server hosting, container management, and serverless computing. You can set code to run to certain triggers using Lambda, run virtual machines using Elastic Compute Cloud or EC2, quickly set up and run small websites using LightSail, or create a unit of software to ship out to your users using Elastic Container Services or ECS. Compute services are backbones of cloud computing platforms as they provide the much-coveted computing resources that many companies are looking for. Instead of having to host their own servers in their own data centers, they can rent servers from AWS for pennies on the dollar. Storage services provide storage for both in-use and archival files. You can use Elastic File System or EFS to create shared folders in the cloud. You can upload flat files like images, videos, or text files to Simple Storage Service or S3 and link to it directly to use on your website. You can also archive files and store large amounts of data for cheap using Glacier or you can use Storage Gateway to take daily backups of your company's on-premises data and send them to the cloud for safekeeping. Storage solutions are cheaper than ever with cloud computing and AWS provides many options depending on the frequency of access and durability of data you require. AWS also offers fully-managed relational and NoSQL databases. Their cost-efficient relational database is called Relational Database Service or RDS and a highly scalable NoSQL database is called DynamoDB. They also offer a fully managed, easily scalable petabyte-scale data warehouse service called Redshift and a highly scalable caching service called ElastiCache. ElastiCache allows you to run extremely intensive computations by caching necessary data in the cloud. All of the database services are highly scalable and cost efficient so you can crunch all the numbers and data you need for a fraction of the cost of an on-site database server. It's easy to get lost in the abundance of options but it's also exciting to consider the almost limitless potentials in what we can create using these resources.
