### 1.1 Security in the Cloud

Transcript:
Security in the Cloud. If you're anything like me, when you think about security for your data and your IT infrastructure, you probably think of the server room in your office, locked with a card key that only the IT department has. Or maybe your company has a data center off-site that you have to drive two hours to get to, to make sure your backups are being saved securely. When you get to the data center, you probably encounter a lot of security personnel and need to submit a lot of credentials to step into the facility and get anywhere near the servers. This image of securing data is quickly being replaced by cloud-based security where you no longer have to keep costly data centers functioning and secured. Instead, you can have a cloud computing service provider manage their own data centers on your behalf so you can focus on other aspects of IT infrastructure management. When you deploy your IT resources into AWS Cloud, you benefit from the global network of data centers and architecture built with security in mind. AWS helps you keep your data safe in their highly secure data centers, and there are safeguards in place to help protect customer privacy. There are dozens of compliance programs embedded into AWS to help you meet your industry's compliance requirements for data security. Securing your data on AWS Cloud allows you to maintain the highest standard of security without having to manage your own data centers, which saves you time and money. It also allows you to scale the size of your business quickly, as AWS is designed to keep data safe no matter how big or small your cloud usage is. Let's learn about a few concepts and frameworks for security in the cloud before discussing specific security-related services that AWS offers.
